# counterstrike-skin-price-fetch
A script for fetching skin prices from the steam marketplace

The API has a max fetch size (500?), which is why I'm only pulling one collection at a time. I think this could be solved with multiple fetches (and perhaps some scheduling to not be blocked by the API), but I have moved on from this project by now
